## About me

### School/Academic Stuff
**Computer Science major, Transfer student** 

I'm a student at [Warren College!](https://warren.ucsd.edu)

*Below is a piece advice often quoted but not always followed among CS majors.*
> Start early, start often.

Examples of quoted code for Part 3 of Lab 1:

`#define TRUE FALSE`

`if(true){
    return true;
 }
 else{
    return false;
 }`

**PL I have knowledge of:**
1. C++
2. Java

Coming from community college, these are the languages I've been exposed to, which might be less than other students. 

I have some surface level knowledge of other PL but I hope my existing experience will make adopting new tools easy!

### Interests
+ Running 
+ Listening to Music
+ Playing video games (mostly real time strategy, rpgs, and sim racing)
+ Casual fan of NBA (Lakers) and F1 (Redbull)
